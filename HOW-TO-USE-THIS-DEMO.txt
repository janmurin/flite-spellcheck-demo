This demo folder provides an example of integrating FLITE into your CKEditor-enabled page.

To use the demo, you need place a ckeditor folder inside this folder, then copy your flite folder
(the one that includes plugin.js) into ckeditor/plugins.
You may, of course, use any soft-link/virtual-folder technique that you want
in order to set up the same logical structure.
